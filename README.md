* Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

As a proud member of an Engineering company, Global Rain, we are tasked with modernizing a clients software operations and implement the most current and effective software security. Our client, Artemis Financial, is a financial cconsulting company. They are known for developing financial plans for savings, retirements, investments, and insurance. These plans are individualized for each of their clients specific needs. Our clients needs our expertise to implement the highest proection and security from any external threats.

* What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

The area that I found particularly interesting and did well is identifying the vulnerabilites that were false positives. Security should be a top priority for any developing team and QA/testing teams. Testing early and continually throughout the process will help reduce any potential defects or vulnerable code. 

* What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?


* How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?


* How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


* What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?


* Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
