CS-305-Software Security
# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

As a proud member of an Engineering company, Global Rain, we are tasked with modernizing a clients software operations and implement the most current and effective software security. Our client, Artemis Financial, is a financial cconsulting company. They are known for developing financial plans for savings, retirements, investments, and insurance. These plans are individualized for each of their clients specific needs. Our clients needs our expertise to implement the highest proection and security from any external threats.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

The area that I found particularly interesting and did well is identifying the vulnerabilites that were false positives. Security should be a top priority for any developing team and QA/testing teams. Testing early and continually throughout the process will help reduce any potential defects or vulnerable code. Implementing security protocols should be considered for any software and is an important value to a company. Having vulnerabilities in software and not worrying about an intrusion can lead to having negative repercussions and the company's repuation may be affected. Having secure software will strengthen the company's wellbeing.

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The process that I found the most challenging in the vulnerability assessment was running through each dependency and understanding each vunerability. It was more time consuming more than anything. The process that I found helpful was learning how to suppress the vulnerabilities as well as learning to read the dependency check report. 

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

A way that I increased the layers of securiity is through the dependency checks to see which vulnerability you currently have and refactor the code and run another dependency check. Another way is to continually read up on and monitor any information regarding security and staying current on what new vulnerabilities are preset worldwide. Staying current is an important technique. One of the tools that I recently found that might be helpful in the future is the Hash Online tool to check the functionality. The link is below.

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

As I wrote the code within the IDE, the first step is to ensure there are no sytax errors. Testing and running the code to ensure it is functional is key and reduces issues in the final code. Running the Maven test helped determine the code was free of errors and was could help detect any vulnerabilites within the code. Conducting the maven test throughout the process will help run a dependency check and ensure there aren't any new vulnerabilites indroduced. 

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The resources that I used the most was through our class resource page. I found the tool: OWASP Dependency-Check-Maven website very useful as well as well as some other resources such as Stack Overflow for examples of code on a particular issue. I have also found that learning how to create certificates and implementing them into the code will be very useful in future assignements, i.e., website development.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
